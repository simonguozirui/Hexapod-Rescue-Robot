# Hexapod-Rescue-Robot
A project I created from October 2015 until now

Hexapod Rescue robot is a low-cost, highly-efficient, small robot, using different sensor and smarter algorithm. It can adapt
to different kinds of terrains, search and report people in danger of fires, earthquakes, gas leaks, and other situations.
